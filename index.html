   <h1>Hey My Dear 💕</h1>

   <p>
   I’m not even going to lie… the first time I saw your post, I was like,
   “Okayyy… who allowed her to look this good?” 😌
   That’s when the little crush started.
   </p>

   <p>
   Now listen… I’m not going to rush and say I love you yet — I still need
   to meet you properly and confirm if you’re this amazing in real life too 😂
   </p>

   <p>
   But what I can confidently say right now is that I really like you.
   You seem like such a beautiful soul, and I want to know you more —
   slowly, properly… no pressure.
   </p>

   <p>
   One day, when I know you well enough, I might even write a whole page
   about you. Don’t worry, I’ll make you sound legendary 😉
   </p>

   <p>
   Happy Valentine’s Day, ML ❤️
   (Don’t let this small crush grow too fast… unless you want it to 😏)
